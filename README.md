# Play music from your awesome command line

So you are a geek, and you just want to start listening music with your lovely command line.

But you do not know what to listen, since you are a such lazy guy.

Sure, try this: `$ ./jingfm play -u xvfeng -p xvfeng -k rock`

```

success logged in to Jing.fm ...
trying to get play list...
trying to get song url...
trying to open it in the browser
enjoy the song!
```

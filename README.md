# Play music from your awesome command line

### So you are a geek, and you just want to start listening music with your lovely command line.

### But you do not know what to listen, since you are a such lazy guy.

### 'Can I just type in my mood or class name of the music, and I want the code to do the rest thing?'

### Sure, try this:

```
$ ./jingfm -u xvfeng -p xvfeng -k rock
```

### Don't know how to use it?

### Try

```
$ ./jingfm --help
```

### Ok, that's it. You are welcome!
